## Work Done Last Year

<p>Describe the work done last year</p>
The work we did last year was gather all the data we needed, understand what it means, identify the features that need to be pre-processed and extracted and identified the transformations to be used on extracted features. We first tested several speech recognition models using python speech recognition module and made a spreadsheet of the children audio datasets. Then, we created a pre-processing pipeline where we extracted the audio signals from the files and removed the background noise from the signal as well. 

We also created applied a pre-emphasis filter where we created a log-mel spectrogram of pre-emphasis signal and generated the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients as features. We then researched various feature selection techniques and identified models such as the Generative Adversarial Networks and the Probabilistic Inference Models. This year, we hope to implement deep learning architecture, Hidden Markov Models, and to get better inference results, we will combine deep learning with our HMM output from the porbabilistic models.
